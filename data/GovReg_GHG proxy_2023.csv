,Abstract,,,,,,,,
,"Approximated estimates for greenhouse gas emissions is a dataset required under the Governance Regulation 2018/1999. The reporting obligation requires Member States to annually report approximated greenhouse gas inventories by 31 July. A Union approximated greenhouse gas inventory is annually compiled on the basis of the Member Statesâ€™ approximated greenhouse gas inventories or, if a Member State has not communicated its approximated inventories by that date, on the basis of own estimates. The data refers to estimates of emissions in the year 2023.

This reporting obligation comes from the Governance Regulation 2018/1999, Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1208 (Annex VI).",,,,,,,,
