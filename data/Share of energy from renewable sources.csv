SHort Assessment of Renewable Energy Sources

The objective of the SHARES tool is to facilitate the calculation of the share of
energy from renewable sources according to Directive 2009/28/EC for years up to 2020 and according to Directive (EU) 2018/2001 for 2021 onwards.
Methodology details and additional information is also available:

"SHARES tool version 2020 (used to obtain results from 2004 to 2020 in this file) takes into account specific calculation provisions as in place in Directive 2009/28/EC (RED I), whereas SHARES tool version 2021 (used to obtain 2021 and 2022 results) follows Directive (EU) 2018/2001 (RED II). "


"Due to the change of legal basis, a break in series occurs between 2020 and 2021. Other possible breaks in time series could be explained by various issues, including a late transposition of Directives or a change in statistical methodology. Readers are encouraged to analyse the differences between both Directives (RED I and RED II), the energy sector and all national specificities before drawing any conclusions from the data presented in this file."
